# henry-schein-take-home-test

Because this app is so small, I didn't bother to creat MVC directories.
I didn't use String.split(), because my auto-fill says it takes a regex, which is off-limits for this assignment.
There are no doubt other ways to accomplish this task, but without using regex, this was the most efficient way I came up with in my short time working today.

Thanks!
